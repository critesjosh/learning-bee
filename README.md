 - The site tracks how much of a video students watch, or assess knowledge with quizzes, tests and assignments
 - As students learn they get tokens
 - Learning Bee has partnerships with local governments and corporations to allow students to pay for basic goods and services used Learning Bee tokens
Examples include:
 - Paying utility bills
 - Public transportation passes
 - Tax write-offs 
 - Food stamps

Why would companies and governments participate?
 - Investment in the local population
 - A great public service
 - Allow under-employed people to easily earn some income to cover basic necessities
 - Reduce the social burden

What additional benefits are there?
 - If these tokens are recognized as useful, they may be adopted as a complementary currency

Requirements
 - KYC
 - Government / corporate buy in
 - Student progress tracking
 - How do students have their tokens minted? They canâ€™t mint them theirself, this must be done server-side, or at least done by authorized users. Perhaps the companies and governments that accept the tokens as payment will be authorized to mint tokens. They will be incentivized to be strict about this, since they are the ones that accept these tokens as payment.
 - Burner wallet
